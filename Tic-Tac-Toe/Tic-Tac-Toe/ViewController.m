//  User Guide
//  Fundamental Knowledge
//  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
//  The program is a digital recreation of the classic game tic-tac-toe, also known as naughts and crosses.
//  The general rules of the game are that the two players are assigned a different marker, either a naught(O) or a cross(X).
//  Each player will then take turns to fill one of the sections of the grid with their assigned marker.
//  Once a grid section has been filled it cannot be used again until the game has finished.
//  The game will finish when one of the players has managed to align three of there markers in a line (which results in a win for that player) or if all the grid spaces are filled without a winner being chosen (this results in a draw).
//
//  Rules & Instructions
//  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
//  The player has to align there markers to form a line of three across the board either vertically, horizontally and diagonally from corner to opposite corner.
//  The players must go in alternating order one after the other.
//  To place a marker the current player should click one of the empty box sections on the grid.
//  After one player wins no actions on the grid can be executed until the grid is cleared/reset.
//
//  FAQ
//  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
//  Q: How do you place a marker?
//  A: You click one of the block locations on the application,
//  this should place the marker relevant to the turn in that place.
//
//  Q: The game has come to a draw, what now?
//  A: Click the reset button, this should clear the board to make the game ready to play another game.
//
//  Q: Is this just naughts and crosses?
//  A: Yes...
